			<p>Japanese orthography is mostly consistent when it comes to basic kana. A character in general will always be pronounced the same within words. There are, however, a few exceptions. The major one people find is the topic particle, written は, but pronounced the same as わ (/wa/). I'll also talk about its sister cases (particles へ and を).</p>
<h3 id="why">Why?<a class="zola-anchor" href="#why" aria-label="Anchor link for: why">🔗</a></h3>
<p>The reason is historical, relating to sound changes in the language.  Until recent orthographic reform in the 20th century, kana orthography was actually quite a mess and had diverged from how the language was actually spoken. One example is what happened with the は行<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#1">1</a></sup>. Many instances of は had come to be pronounced わ, and many instances of ひふへほ had shifted into いうえお, respectively.</p>
<p>The reform standardized usage so that a few kana were obsoleted, and the sound↔writing relationship was better maintained across the language. However, for 3 grammatical particles, their usage would remain the same. 
Those particles were は, へ, and を. In other words:</p>
<ul>
<li>は as a particle had come to be pronounced the same as わ.</li>
<li>へ as a particle had come to be pronounced the same as え.</li>
<li>を as a particle had come to be pronounced the same as お.</li>
</ul>
<p>But the reform chose to leave them as is in writing.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#2">2</a></sup></p>
<h3 id="how">How am I supposed to tell?<a class="zola-anchor" href="#how" aria-label="Anchor link for: how">🔗</a></h3>
<p>Something that might worry beginners is: how is one supposed to know if は is actually /ha/ or /wa/ then? In reality, differentiating them is not really an issue as you get used to Japanese.</p>
<p>は is pronounced as /wa/ only as a particle<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#3">3</a></sup>. As you get a better understanding of Japanese grammar it'll be easy to tell. At an early stage where you're reading stuff mostly written in kana it's a bit harder, but in a text with kanji it gets much, much easier.</p>
<h4 id="konnichiwa">Is it wrong to write こんにちわ?<a class="zola-anchor" href="#konnichiwa" aria-label="Anchor link for: konnichiwa">🔗</a></h4>
<p>Now, I said it's pronounced this way &quot;only&quot; as a particle. This is both true and not. Some words have the は particle &quot;built into&quot; them due to their etymology, such that it's really not <em>acting</em> as a particle anymore, but you still write は though you say /wa/. This happens to be the case for こんにちは and こんばんは, which are very common words and a reason beginners might get frustrated by this は↔わ thing.</p>
<p>こんにちは, if translated very literally, only means &quot;as for today&quot;. It's actually shortened from larger expressions, like &quot;How are you today&quot; or &quot;It's quite hot today isn't it.&quot; So that は at the end is in fact the topic particle, it's just not actually acting like it because the expression has been shortened. So, it's &quot;built-in,&quot; it's still written は but pronounced as わ.</p>
<p>Now, you'll actually see Japanese people writing こんにちわ online. That is, however, somewhat slangy. It's not considered the &quot;proper&quot; form, and this would only be done, say, as a sort of casual greeting in a chatroom or something. </p>
<p>So in a sense, writing it like that could be seen as a sign of fluency if you're doing it intentionally in the right context. Within learning communities, though, this should be avoided, because:</p>
<ul>
<li>Even if you are aware of what you're doing, a person of lower level might not be, and just end up adopting it without understanding.</li>
<li>You'll often be corrected, even if you didn't need to be. Because there are many beginners that do this as a mistake, it's natural that this be pointed out and corrected. It's hard for those around you to know if <em>you</em> know what you're doing.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="dewa">What about ではない and ではありません?<a class="zola-anchor" href="#dewa" aria-label="Anchor link for: dewa">🔗</a></h4>
<p>ではない and its polite form ではありません are grammatical constructions people run into early on, though depending on what material you use to study you might initially learn them as じゃない and じゃありません and only later find out about the では forms. They also have は pronounced as わ. Is it acting as a particle or is it another case like こんにちは?</p>
<p>It's fine to look at it as a case similar to こんにちは without thinking too much about it. These constructions have solidified and work as the default negation for だ and です respectively. These were so common that a contraction developed where the the で and は(/wa/) sounds merged into じゃ and those forms have overtaken the usage of the originals (i.e. じゃない is now more common in speech than ではない). So you can just think of it as a single thing and ignore the more complex explanation.</p>
<p>It is however a bit different than the こんにちは case, because the word that gives origin to ではない is still a major part of the language. The details for how this works touch on more advanced topics and might not really help clear things up that much, so if you're not that familiar with the grammar yet I'd recommend ignoring this and jumping ahead. The basic idea of it is: ではない comes from である. While looking very similar to ある, である is a copula (meaning it plays a role similar to だ or です) and there's not that much to be gained trying to connect it conceptually to the modern ある. However, it's a strange word because some things can go <em>in-between</em> the で and ある bits, most notably the particles は and も. The negative form of である is, in a strict sense, でない, and you'll still see it like that sometimes, but ではない was so much more common that it essentially became the default. Similarly, when you get more into more advanced material you'll also see ではある, でもある, and でもない used to give different nuances. While the basic affirmative copula changed from である to だ (and in polite language, です), the negative forms ではない and ではありません stayed as the standard negatives.</p>
<p>So why is ではない more common than でない, to the point that it's the standard negative form? That's a bit of a hard question that goes a bit beyond the scope of this page. It's basically there to give the same nuances は usually gives, fitting in a pattern that you'll see across the language where は shows up in a lot of negative sentences to emphasize the negation. Once again, there isn't really a need to worry about it that much, you can just remember it as a set phrase.</p>
<h3 id="wo">Is を ever pronounced /wo/?<a class="zola-anchor" href="#wo" aria-label="Anchor link for: wo">🔗</a></h3>
<p>Basically, no. You may hear it like that in songs, but people don't usually do that when actually speaking. を is now only ever used for the particle. When representing a /wo/ in words imported from other languages, that's usually ウォ, not ヲ. </p>
<p>If you ever do see ヲ (or を) as part of a word for some reason (e.g. in ヲタク), it would still be pronounced /o/. </p>
<h4 id="obsolete">The obsolete kana<a class="zola-anchor" href="#obsolete" aria-label="Anchor link for: obsolete">🔗</a></h4>
<p>This is more trivia than anything, it's not super relevant, but some learners find it interesting or end up being surprised when they first learn about this. As I said earlier, the orthographic reform obsoleted some kana. Those are:</p>
<ul>
<li>ゑ, in the table position for &quot;we,&quot; and its katakana counterpart ヱ.</li>
<li>ゐ, in the table position for &quot;wi,&quot; and its katakana counterpart ヰ.</li>
</ul>
<p>ゑ and ゐ, just like を, hadn't actually been pronounced /we/ and /wi/ for a long time. They had shifted to /e/ and /i/, so they ended up being redundant and made obsolete. The same thing would probably have happened with を if it hadn't been left around as a particle. </p>
<p>These kana no longer feature in any words, except when used stylistically for names. When you do see them, they'll always be read /e/ and /i/. The sounds /we/ and /wi/ in loan words would be written ウェ and ウィ.</p>

<div class="footnote-definition" id="1"><sup class="footnote-definition-label">1</sup>
<p>&quot;The は column&quot; in the kana table, referring to はひふへほ.</p>
</div>
<div class="footnote-definition" id="2"><sup class="footnote-definition-label">2</sup>
<p>I'm not actually sure why this was done. Perhaps because it makes it easier to go back and read old texts.</p>
</div>
<div class="footnote-definition" id="3"><sup class="footnote-definition-label">3</sup>
<p>Likewise, へ is only pronounced /e/ as a particle</p>
