			<p>Japanese orthography is mostly consistent when it comes to basic kana. A character in general will always be pronounced the same within words. There are, however, a few exceptions. The major one people find is the topic particle, written は, but pronounced the same as わ (/wa/). I'll also talk about its sister cases (particles へ and を).</p>
<h3 id="why">Why?<a class="zola-anchor" href="#why" aria-label="Anchor link for: why">🔗</a></h3>
<p>The reason is historical, relating to sound changes in the language.  Until recent orthographic reform in the 20th century, kana orthography was actually quite a mess and had diverged from how the language was actually spoken. One example is what happened with the は行<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#1">1</a></sup>. Many words written with は now had it being pronounced わ, and many instances of ひふへほ had shifted into いうえお, respectively.</p>
<p>The reform standardized usage so that a few kana were obsoleted, and the sound↔writing relationship was better maintained. However, for 3 grammatical particles, their usage would remain the same. 
Those particles were は, へ, and を. In other words:</p>
<ul>
<li>は as a particle had come to be pronounced the same as わ.</li>
<li>へ as a particle had come to be pronounced the same as え.</li>
<li>を as a particle had come to be pronounced the same as お.</li>
</ul>
<p>But the reform chose to leave them as is.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#2">2</a></sup></p>
<h3 id="how">How am I supposed to tell?<a class="zola-anchor" href="#how" aria-label="Anchor link for: how">🔗</a></h3>
<p>Something that might worry beginners is: how is one supposed to know if は is actually /ha/ or /wa/ then? In reality, differentiating them is not really an issue as you get used to Japanese.</p>
<p>は is pronounced as /wa/ only as a particle<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#3">3</a></sup>. As you get a better understanding of Japanese grammar it'll be easy to tell. At an early stage where you're reading stuff mostly written in kana it's a bit harder, but in a text with kanji it gets much, much easier.</p>
<h4 id="konnichiwa">Is it wrong to write こんにちわ?<a class="zola-anchor" href="#konnichiwa" aria-label="Anchor link for: konnichiwa">🔗</a></h4>
<p>Now, I said it's pronounced this way &quot;only&quot; as a particle. This is both true and not. Some words have the は particle &quot;built into&quot; them due to their etymology, such that it's really not <em>acting</em> as a particle anymore, but you still write は though you say /wa/. This happens to be the case for こんにちは and こんばんは, which are very common words and a reason beginners might get frustrated by this は↔わ thing.</p>
<p>こんにちは, if translated very literally, only means &quot;as for today&quot;. It's actually shortened from larger expressions, like &quot;How are you today&quot; or &quot;It's quite hot today isn't it.&quot; So that は at the end is in fact the topic particle, it's just not actually acting like it because the expression has been shortened. So, it's &quot;built-in,&quot; it's still written は but pronounced as わ.</p>
<p>Now, you'll actually see Japanese people writing こんにちわ online. That is, however, somewhat slangy. It's not considered the &quot;proper&quot; form, and this would only be done, say, as a sort of casual greeting in a chatroom or something. </p>
<p>So in a sense, writing it like that could be seen as a sign of fluency if you're doing it intentionally in the right context. Within learning communities, though, this should be avoided, because:</p>
<ul>
<li>Even if you are aware of what you're doing, a person of lower level might not be, and just end up adopting it without understanding.</li>
<li>You'll often be corrected, even if you didn't need to be. Because there are many beginners that do this as a mistake, it's natural that this be pointed out and corrected. It's hard for those around you to know if <em>you</em> know what you're doing.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="wo">Is を ever pronounced /wo/?<a class="zola-anchor" href="#wo" aria-label="Anchor link for: wo">🔗</a></h3>
<p>Basically, no. You may hear it like that in songs, but people don't do that when actually speaking. を is now only ever used for the particle. When representing a /wo/ in words imported from other languages, that's usually ウォ, not ヲ. </p>
<p>If you ever do see ヲ (or を) as part of a word for some reason (e.g. in ヲタク), it would still be pronounced /o/. </p>
<h4 id="obsolete">The obsolete kana<a class="zola-anchor" href="#obsolete" aria-label="Anchor link for: obsolete">🔗</a></h4>
<p>This is more trivia than anything, it's not super relevant, but some learners find it interesting or end up being surprised when they first learn about this. As I said earlier, the orthographic reform obsoleted some kana. Those are:</p>
<ul>
<li>ゑ, in the table position for &quot;we,&quot; and its katakana counterpart ヱ.</li>
<li>ゐ, in the table position for &quot;wi,&quot; and its katakana counterpart ヰ.</li>
</ul>
<p>ゑ and ゐ, just like を, hadn't actually been pronounced /we/ and /wi/ for a long time. They had shifted to /e/ and /i/, so they ended up being redundant and made obsolete. The same thing would probably have happened with を if it hadn't been left around as a particle. </p>
<p>These kana no longer feature in any words, except when used stylistically for names. When you do see them, they'll always be read /e/ and /i/. The sounds /we/ and /wi/ in loan words would be written ウェ and ウィ.</p>

<div class="footnote-definition" id="1"><sup class="footnote-definition-label">1</sup>
<p>&quot;The は column&quot; in the kana table, referring to はひふへほ.</p>
</div>
<div class="footnote-definition" id="2"><sup class="footnote-definition-label">2</sup>
<p>I'm not actually sure why this was done. Perhaps because it makes it easier to go back and read old texts.</p>
</div>
<div class="footnote-definition" id="3"><sup class="footnote-definition-label">3</sup>
<p>Likewise, へ is only pronounced /e/ as a particle</p>
