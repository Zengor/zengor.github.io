			<p>A lot of people come in with the idea that to get better what they need to do is to actually produce sentences in the language. &quot;You only learn by using&quot; seems to be the operating philosophy. This leads them to either try to make sentences in a vacuum or jump right into trying to hold as many conversations in Japanese as they can as early as possible. I believe this is a wrong path to take early on, or at the very least, it's not as good as some seem to think, so I'd like to go over the potential pitfalls.</p>
<p>Whether you're just trying to write random sentences to practice a grammar point, or actually talking to a real human being, a important question is: how do you know if it sounds natural or unnatural? The reality is that there are many ways to make unnatural sentences that are entirely grammatical. Language often develops such that certain ways to say things are more common than other potential alternatives, some words are only used in some contexts, and so on. This is the kind of thing you learn through <em>input</em>. By exposing yourself to the language, and seeing what people say and how they say it, you get a better internal idea of how to say what you want to say.</p>
<p>Practicing output is important for overall mastery of the language, but it generally only improves your ability to produce output, not any of the other skills related to the language. Trying to make sentences and saying things is specifically practicing your brain's ability to put together elements you know in the order you need them in a reasonable amount of time. You can't simply figure out how something is usually said in a language just by trying to say it.</p>
<p>Now let's think about what happens when you try to make a sentence. Ideally, you would use your experience to figure out what words to use and what a natural phrasing would be. If you don't have experience, you'll usually rely on dictionaries or asking people. If you are in a real conversation, you might end up saying something in a way that you think is incorrect, hoping your conversation partner will still understand and give you a correction.</p>
<h4 id="looking-up-words-in-dictionaries">Looking up words in dictionaries<a href=#looking-up-words-in-dictionaries class="zola-anchor">#</a>
</h4>
<p>Looking up words in dictionaries can be problematic when trying to make a Japanese sentence. For one thing, most of the widely used dictionaries are J-E, meaning they index Japanese entries and give their English definitions. This structure means that the dictionary is aiming to help you understand what the Japanese word means, and not aiming to help you find the equivalent to an English word you're trying to say. Searching for an English word in these dictionaries is insufficient. </p>
<p>A related issue, that is initially more subtle, is that English words themselves have multiple meanings. When you have a clear idea in your head of which meaning you're referring to, the actual word in isolation doesn't hold that information. And so, a very innocent look up that you would think couldn't possibly fail might give you a result that is just completely different from what you want because you forgot to consider that this word has multiple meanings, and having the preconceived notion that the word is simple might lead you to just to miss the signs that it's wrong.</p>
<p>There are deeper problems as well. When thinking in English, you might simply not realize how much of your sentence is idiomatic, or involves words whose meanings have broadened in a very specific way, and therefore has no word-for-word translation. This often comes up with seemingly basic terms like &quot;have&quot; or &quot;get,&quot; but can involve situations where you are trapped in the English wording you initially thought of, when you should at least be trying to think of synonyms that might help you find what you want. Even then, you can't really be sure you aren't walking down a blind alley. Ultimately Japanese is not English, and you might be approaching something in a completely wrong way by trying to adapt an English thought instead of considering what experience tells you is said in similar situations in Japanese.</p>

</h4>
<p>So, how about just getting help? A human is probably better suited than a dictionary, at least. But to know what you should say, someone needs to know what you <em>want</em> to say. From experience I can tell you that when people come in asking &quot;how do I say x&quot; or &quot;is this sentence correct&quot; they are rarely, if ever, clear enough about the context for their sentence or what their intention with it is. </p>
<p>It can be hard for the person answering your question to tackle all the nuances that might be involved in the different choices for how you might phrase it. If you're actually talking to someone it's not as bad: you can usually describe a reasonably concrete context and as long you get your meaning across you'll probably be fine, regardless of the minutiae of the language. </p>
<p>However, asking about random sentences you make for practice makes this more complicated and harder for the one answering. When trying to think of a sentence, people usually reach upon a package that is reasonanbly complete and understandable in English, and just want to adapt it to Japanese. However, this &quot;complete&quot; package might involve many things they don't think about. As I mentioned before for dictionaries, what might seem like a simple word choice may actually hold many potential meanings, or be a hard feeling to fully capture in Japanese, with the best way to phrase it depending on full context. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, &quot;full context&quot; isn't usually a part of this process to begin with. When asked to clarify, people usually don't have a concrete image in their head and think one up right then. After receiving a more concrete context it's easier to give an answer, but there's a chance that many misunderstandings happen in this process. For example, with a context just invented on the spot while trying to get an answer quickly, there's always the danger that you'll be generalizing an answer that was meant to be specific to that context.</p>
<p>If you get an answer as-is, without additional inquiry, that means the person answered tried to assume a rasonable context. However, it's dangerous to then assume that answer is general. What might serve for the context they imagined isn't necessarily good for other context where the exact same English sentence would be appropriate. If you didn't specify what you wanted to say at all, that's even more dangerous, as the answerer had to assume what you were trying to say.</p>
<p>All of this together creates a situation where you can get answers, but your answer may not be for the question you had in your head. If you try to get a full breakdown, to make sure you get all the different possibilities, that usually takes a <em>lot</em> of time and effort from the person answering your question, which can be a lot to ask.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#1">1</a></sup><sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#2">2</a></sup> </p>
<h4 id="just-hoping-for-corrections">Just hoping for corrections<a href=#just-hoping-for-corrections class="zola-anchor">#</a>
</h4>
<p>So, if you are in a real conversation, hopefully your conversation partner will just correct you. But will they? Stopping to correct your grammar and word choice is very disruptive to the flow of any conversation. And it actually takes about as much effort as any other form of correction, as I somewhat touched on in the previous section. First, they need to be able to understand your intention, which is not necessarily going to happen, then they have a couple of choices of how to relay the correction. </p>
<p>If they choose to just point it out quickly as a &quot;it's not x, it's y,&quot; the conversation can move on quickly but in a lot of situations that will just raise the question of why. Is x fundamentally wrong? Is it wrong in this specific sentence? Why is y correct? Is there a way to change the sentence to use x? And so on. Not to mention they might have just misunderstood what you were trying to say. Depending on what is being corrected you may already understand the mistake as it was just a slip-up, but if it wasn't, this correction doesn't give you <em>that</em> much information.</p>
<p>If they stop to give you a full explanation, your conversation has halted. If that explanation itself is in Japanese, you're at least still interacting with the language directly, but depending on how technical it is, itcould go over your head. However, no matter the length, depth, or language of the explanation, for your partner it has turned from a casual conversation into a tutoring session. This requires a different level of energy, and, as I mentioned, it's disruptive, so many mistakes are likely to just be let go in favor of keeping the rhythm of the convo. Being forced to constantly make corrections generally makes the conversation less fun for your partner.</p>
<p>By the way, if you're talking to an average native speaker, they might not even be able to explain why something is right or wrong in the first place. This is completely normal. As native speakers, they don't have to consciously know the rules, they just understand intuitively. Just imagine how well you could explain things about your native language without any previous training in it. In fact, trying to force an explanation from a native speaker might lead to some surprisingly wrong observations. They can tell you if a sentence feels natural or how they would phrase something, but usually not why that is the case.</p>
<h4 id="conclusion">Conclusion<a href=#conclusion class="zola-anchor">#</a>
</h4>
<p>As such, there's actually not that much value in trying to force yourself to speak as much Japanese as you can, at least not in the way some seem to attempt it. Particularly at the beginner stages, you really don't have much ground to hold a full conversation. It's likely to be so full of mistakes no one can be bothered point them all out and explaining what is wrong, if they can even understand you in the first place.</p>
<p>I am not, however, saying you should <em>never</em> have conversations in Japanese. You probably do want to practice output at some point, after all. But beyond that, conversations are also a form of input. Even if you're not getting your mistakes corrected, you are at least getting to see how your partner talks in a natural environment and reacts to what you say, and there's plenty to be learned there, especially if you enjoy talking to people and have partners willing to help you with serious mistakes. It's just better to take advantage of this when you have a bit more skill so you can not only know what you're supposed to say, but also take less effort understanding your conversation partner.</p>
<p>Practice speaking Japanese, sure, but forcing output is not what will lead to a better understanding of Japanese. It's constant exposure to the language that allows you to internalize it and create that feeling of what sounds natural. So early on I'd recommend focusing on getting that exposure above direct output practice.</p>

<p>Especially if they're just strangers on the internet, and not personally invested in your studies.</p>

<div class="footnote-definition" id="2"><sup class="footnote-definition-label">2</sup>
<p>A connected problem here, when it comes to asking random people online, is that people who see all the different possibilities and don't want to give a misleading oversimplified answer become <em>less</em> likely to answer as they see the effort that is required to really partake all the information. On the other end of the spectrum, you have people that don't actually know that much and just want to help, who are very likely to give a single, quick answer; one that is what they could think of or find that fits basic understanding of the question. Needless to say, these answers can be completely wrong, even if no well-intentioned.</p>
