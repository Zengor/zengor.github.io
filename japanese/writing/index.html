				<p>The Japanese writing system is a complex beast and it's something a lot of learners don't understand or get confused by. I'm going to try and break it down at a high level, covering some common misunderstandings.</p>
<p>The Japanese writing system has 3 major parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hiragana</li>
<li>Katakana</li>
<li>Kanji</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also include hindu-arabic numerals and the latin alphabet (romaji), but let's leave those aside for now.</p>
<h1 id="the-kana">The Kana<a class="zola-anchor" href="#the-kana" aria-label="Anchor link for: the-kana">ðŸ”—</a>
</h1>
<p>Hiragana and Katakana are together known as &quot;kana.&quot; They are syllabaries, meaning that they (mostly) represent syllables. In reality, a single kana represents a &quot;mora,&quot; which is a speec unit related to the timing of speech, but we don't need to worry about that for now.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#1">1</a></sup></p>

<p>I might write a more detailed explanation of this later.</p>
