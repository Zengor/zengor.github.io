			<p>The Japanese writing system is a complex beast and it's something a lot of learners don't understand or get confused by. I'm going to try and break it down at a high level, covering some common misunderstandings.</p>
<p>The Japanese writing system has 3 major parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hiragana</li>
<li>Katakana</li>
<li>Kanji</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also include hindu-arabic numerals and the latin alphabet (romaji), but let's leave those aside for now.</p>

</h1>
<p>Hiragana and Katakana are together known as &quot;kana.&quot; They are syllabaries, meaning that they (mostly) represent syllables. In reality, a single kana represents a &quot;mora,&quot; which is a speec unit related to the timing of speech, but we don't need to worry about that for now.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#1">1</a></sup></p>
<h1 id="kanji">Kanji<a class="zola-anchor" href="#kanji" aria-label="Anchor link for: kanji">🔗</a>
</h1>
<h3 id="kanji-aren-t-words">Kanji Aren't Words<a class="zola-anchor" href="#kanji-aren-t-words" aria-label="Anchor link for: kanji-aren-t-words">🔗</a>
</h3>
<p>Because kanji have meaning, some get the wrong impression that kanji are themselves words, and so if a kanji means X, you just have to throw it in a sentence where that word should be. This is seen most often at a beginner level, when people are trying to force sentences out, and end up searching the dictionary for kanji instead of words (or have otherwise learned the kanji and assume it can stand on its own). I guess under that perspective, compounds would only be &quot;complicated&quot; or &quot;non-basic&quot; words. <strong>This is simply not the case.</strong></p>
<p>It's important to remember that kanji are a <em>form of writing</em>. They may have influenced the formation of words, but that doesn't mean they are words. A kanji having a meaning will not necessarily represent a word with that meaning when used by itself. Now, some kanji will, in fact, be interpreted as a word when written alone, but you can't just assume that will be the case. </p>
<p>Let's take look at some examples of kanji↔word relationships.</p>
