			<p>Some people try to use songs as a learning resource, be it for listening practice or finding vocabulary or whatever else. However, I believe they are generally not an effective way to practice at a beginner or intermediate level, and I'd like to go over some reasons why. If it's something you enjoy doing, I can't really say you shouldn't do it. If understanding songs and lyrics is somehow one of the main reasons behind your studies of Japanese, then please do use songs for practice, as that is inherently part of your goal. But either way, I think it's important to be aware of some things.</p>
<p>I believe the goals of most Japanese learners fall into two broad camps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Understanding and partaking in conversational Japanese.</li>
<li>Being able to read written Japanese (usually, prose).</li>
</ul>
<p>These are quite generalized and vague, but most people seem to want some combination of these at varying degrees<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#1">1</a></sup>, with some going into more specific areas (reading old Japanese, or whatever else). Song lyrics are neither prose nor conversational Japanese, they are poetry if anything. Now, they may sometimes try to approximate speech or feature things you'd also see in prose, but that doesn't change the fact that the structure is inherently different and songs are generally not going to be actual conversations, nor are they going to be good sample to eventually lead to an understanding of  novels or essays or whatever else.</p>
<p>This isn't inherently bad, after all, it is still an aspect of the language and it makes sense to want to be able to understand songs if your goal is just a very general &quot;want to know Japanese&quot; in a way similar to your native language.</p>
<p>Songs are not necessarily great listening practice, either. It's already natural that music does not match the rhythm of speech, so you won't really be exposed to the actual &quot;flow&quot; of a conversation. On top of that, many genres involve playing phonetically with the words quite a bit, for example, you may hear a lot of rolled 'r's in some songs but that's not really a thing in real speech.</p>
<div class="footnote-definition" id="1"><sup class="footnote-definition-label">1</sup>
<p>For example, someone who is mostly interested in reading novels will want to focus on reading comprehension, including the need to know enough conversational Japanese to understand dialogue, though they don't necessarily need to value listening comprehension. Someone interested in just holding spoken conversations with Japanese speakers needs to worry much less about literary vocabulary or sentence structures, but being completely illiterate would be detrimental, not only for a relative lack of learning resources, but because they wouldn't be able to really communicate effectively online. Someone who just wants to watch anime needs to practice listening comprehension, but not necessarily of the same kind as for real speech, and the breadth of the necessary vocabulary will vary based on what they want to watch. Of course, one's goals may be an abstract combination of many different things and so it can be hard to judge what you really need.</p>
