			<p>Some people try to use songs as a learning resource, be it for listening practice or finding vocabulary or whatever else. However, I believe they are generally not an effective way to practice at a beginner or intermediate level, and I'd like to go over some reasons why. If it's something you enjoy doing, I can't really say you shouldn't do it. If understanding songs and lyrics is somehow one of the main reasons behind your studies of Japanese, then please do use songs for practice, as that is inherently part of your goal. But if that's not the case, they won't help with the overall language as much as some might think.</p>

<p>I believe the goals of most Japanese learners fall into two broad camps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Understanding and partaking in conversational Japanese.</li>
<li>Being able to read written Japanese (usually, prose).</li>
</ul>
<p>These are quite generalized and vague, but most people seem to want a combination of these<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#1">1</a></sup>. Song lyrics are neither prose nor conversational Japanese, they are poetry if anything. Now, they may sometimes try to approximate speech or feature things you'd also see in prose, but that doesn't change the fact that the structure is inherently different. People that have had to look at poetry in school will probably understand</p>

<p>For example, someone who is mostly interested in reading novels will want to focus on reading comprehension, including the need to know enough conversational Japanese to understand dialogue, though they don't necessarily need to value listening comprehension. Someone interested in just holding spoken conversations with Japanese speakers needs to worry much less about literary vocabulary or sentence structures, but being completely illiterate would be detrimental, not only for a relative lack of learning resources, but because they wouldn't be able to really communicate effectively online. Someone who just wants to watch anime needs to practice listening comprehension, but not necessarily of the same kind as for real speech, and the breadth of the necessary vocabulary will vary based on what they want to watch. Of course, one's goals may be an abstract combination of many different things and so it can be hard to judge what you really need.</p>
