		<p>I'm a Brazilian programmer with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from University of Fortaleza, currently living in Japan. I'm interested in data strcutures, algorithms, programming languages, mathematical optmization, among many other things. I basically find anything that is a bit abstract to be really interesting. I'm not really a front-end person. I also like writing documentation.</p>
<p>My favorite programming languages are Rust and Python, though I also have quite a bit of experience with Java since that was the main language for my university classes. I enjoy learning new languages and I'm particularly interested in spending more time with Go, Erlang, Haskell and Clojure.</p>
<p>I speak Portuguese, English and Japanese. In my spare time I enjoy reading, listening to music and playing video games. I also really love Magic: the Gathering.</p>
