This leads them to either try to make sentences in a vacuum or jump right into trying to hold as many conversations in Japanese as they can as early as possible. I believe this is a wrong path to take early on, or at the very least, it's not as good as some seem to think, so I'd like to go over the potential pitfalls.\nWhether you're just trying to write random sentences to practice a grammar point, or actually talking to a real human being, a important question is: how do you know if it sounds natural or unnatural? The reality is that there are many ways to make unnatural sentences that are entirely grammatical. Language often develops such that certain ways to say things are more common than other potential alternatives, some words are only used in some contexts, and so on. This is the kind of thing you learn through input. By exposing yourself to the language, and seeing what people say and how they say it, you get a better internal idea of how to say what you want to say.\nPracticing output is important for overall mastery of the language, but it generally only improves your ability to produce output, not any of the other skills related to the language. Trying to make sentences and saying things is specifically practicing your brain's ability to put together elements you know in the order you need them in a reasonable amount of time. You can't simply figure out how something is usually said in a language just by trying to say it.\nNow let's think about what happens when you try to make a sentence. Ideally, you would use your experience to figure out what words to use and what a natural phrasing would be. If you don't have experience, you'll usually rely on dictionaries or asking people. If you are in a real conversation, you might end up saying something in a way that you think is incorrect, hoping your conversation partner will still understand and give you a correction.\nLooking up words in dictionaries#\n\nLooking up words in dictionaries can be problematic when trying to make a Japanese sentence. For one thing, most of the widely used dictionaries are J-E, meaning they index Japanese entries and give their English definitions. This structure means that the dictionary is aiming to help you understand what the Japanese word means, and not aiming to help you find the equivalent to an English word you're trying to say. Searching for an English word in these dictionaries is insufficient. \nA related issue, that is initially more subtle, is that English words themselves have multiple meanings. When you have a clear idea in your head of which meaning you're referring to, the actual word in isolation doesn't hold that information. And so, a very innocent look up that you would think couldn't possibly fail might give you a result that is just completely different from what you want because you forgot to consider that this word has multiple meanings, and having the preconceived notion that the word is simple might lead you to just to miss the signs that it's wrong.\nThere are deeper problems as well. When thinking in English, you might simply not realize how much of your sentence is idiomatic, or involves words whose meanings have broadened in a very specific way, and therefore has no word-for-word translation. This often comes up with seemingly basic terms like \"have\" or \"get,\" but can involve situations where you are trapped in the English wording you initially thought of, when you should at least be trying to think of synonyms that might help you find what you want. Even then, you can't really be sure you aren't walking down a blind alley. Ultimately Japanese is not English, and you might be approaching something in a completely wrong way by trying to adapt an English thought instead of considering what experience tells you is said in similar situations in Japanese.\nAsking someone#\n\nSo, how about just getting help? A human is probably better suited than a dictionary, at least. But to know what you should say, someone needs to know what you want to say. From experience I can tell you that when people come in asking \"how do I say x\" or \"is this sentence correct\" they are rarely, if ever, clear enough about the context for their sentence or what their intention with it is. \nIt can be hard for the person answering your question to tackle all the nuances that might be involved in the different choices for how you might phrase it. If you're actually talking to someone it's not as bad: you can usually describe a reasonably concrete context and as long you get your meaning across you'll probably be fine, regardless of the minutiae of the language. \nHowever, asking about random sentences you make for practice makes this more complicated and harder for the one answering. When trying to think of a sentence, people usually reach upon a package that is reasonanbly complete and understandable in English, and just want to adapt it to Japanese. However, this \"complete\" package might involve many things they don't think about. As I mentioned before for dictionaries, what might seem like a simple word choice may actually hold many potential meanings, or be a hard feeling to fully capture in Japanese, with the best way to phrase it depending on full context. \nUnfortunately, \"full context\" isn't usually a part of this process to begin with. When asked to clarify, people usually don't have a concrete image in their head and think one up right then. After receiving a more concrete context it's easier to give an answer, but there's a chance that many misunderstandings happen in this process. For example, with a context just invented on the spot while trying to get an answer quickly, there's always the danger that you'll be generalizing an answer that was meant to be specific to that context.\nIf you get an answer as-is, without additional inquiry, that means the person answered tried to assume a rasonable context. However, it's dangerous to then assume that answer is general. What might serve for the context they imagined isn't necessarily good for other context where the exact same English sentence would be appropriate. If you didn't specify what you wanted to say at all, that's even more dangerous, as the answerer had to assume what you were trying to say.\nAll of this together creates a situation where you can get answers, but your answer may not be for the question you had in your head. If you try to get a full breakdown, to make sure you get all the different possibilities, that usually takes a lot of time and effort from the person answering your question, which can be a lot to ask.12 \nJust hoping for corrections#\n\nSo, if you are in a real conversation, hopefully your conversation partner will just correct you. But will they? Stopping to correct your grammar and word choice is very disruptive to the flow of any conversation. And it actually takes about as much effort as any other form of correction, as I somewhat touched on in the previous section. First, they need to be able to understand your intention, which is not necessarily going to happen, then they have a couple of choices of how to relay the correction. \nIf they choose to just point it out quickly as a \"it's not x, it's y,\" the conversation can move on quickly but in a lot of situations that will just raise the question of why. Is x fundamentally wrong? Is it wrong in this specific sentence? Why is y correct? Is there a way to change the sentence to use x? And so on. Not to mention they might have just misunderstood what you were trying to say. Depending on what is being corrected you may already understand the mistake as it was just a slip-up, but if it wasn't, this correction doesn't give you that much information.\nIf they stop to give you a full explanation, your conversation has halted. If that explanation itself is in Japanese, you're at least still interacting with the language directly, but depending on how technical it is, itcould go over your head. However, no matter the length, depth, or language of the explanation, for your partner it has turned from a casual conversation into a tutoring session. This requires a different level of energy, and, as I mentioned, it's disruptive, so many mistakes are likely to just be let go in favor of keeping the rhythm of the convo. Being forced to constantly make corrections generally makes the conversation less fun for your partner.\nBy the way, if you're talking to an average native speaker, they might not even be able to explain why something is right or wrong in the first place. This is completely normal. As native speakers, they don't have to consciously know the rules, they just understand intuitively. Just imagine how well you could explain things about your native language without any previous training in it. In fact, trying to force an explanation from a native speaker might lead to some surprisingly wrong observations. They can tell you if a sentence feels natural or how they would phrase something, but usually not why that is the case.\nConclusion#\n\nAs such, there's actually not that much value in trying to force yourself to speak as much Japanese as you can, at least not in the way some seem to attempt it. Particularly at the beginner stages, you really don't have much ground to hold a full conversation. It's likely to be so full of mistakes no one can be bothered point them all out and explaining what is wrong, if they can even understand you in the first place.\nI am not, however, saying you should never have conversations in Japanese. You probably do want to practice output at some point, after all. But beyond that, conversations are also a form of input. Even if you're not getting your mistakes corrected, you are at least getting to see how your partner talks in a natural environment and reacts to what you say, and there's plenty to be learned there, especially if you enjoy talking to people and have partners willing to help you with serious mistakes. It's just better to take advantage of this when you have a bit more skill so you can not only know what you're supposed to say, but also take less effort understanding your conversation partner.\nPractice speaking Japanese, sure, but forcing output is not what will lead to a better understanding of Japanese. It's constant exposure to the language that allows you to internalize it and create that feeling of what sounds natural. So early on I'd recommend focusing on getting that exposure above direct output practice.\n1\nEspecially if they're just strangers on the internet, and not personally invested in your studies.\n\n2\nA connected problem here, when it comes to asking random people online, is that people who see all the different possibilities and don't want to give a misleading oversimplified answer become less likely to answer as they see the effort that is required to really partake all the information. On the other end of the spectrum, you have people that don't actually know that much and just want to help, who are very likely to give a single, quick answer; one that is what they could think of or find that fits basic understanding of the question. Needless to say, these answers can be completely wrong, even if no well-intentioned.\n\n","id":"https://zengor.github.io/japanese/forcing-output/","title":"On forcing oneself to use Japanese"},"https://zengor.github.io/japanese/topic-pronunciation/":{"body":"Japanese orthography is mostly consistent when it comes to basic kana. A character will in general be pronounced the same within words. There are, however, a few exceptions. The major one people find is the topic particle, written は, but pronounced the same as わ (/wa/). I'll also talk about its sister cases (particles へ and を).\nWhy?#\n\nThe reason is historical, relating to sound changes in the language.  Until recent orthographic reform in the 20th century, kana orthography was actually quite a mess and had diverged significantly from how the language was actually spoken. One example is what happened with the は行1. Many instances of は had come to be pronounced わ, and many instances of ひふへほ had shifted into いうえお, respectively.\nThe reform standardized usage so that a few kana were obsoleted, and the sound↔writing relationship was better maintained across the language. However, for 3 grammatical particles, their usage would remain the same. \nThose particles were は, へ, and を. In other words:\n\nは as a particle had come to be pronounced the same as わ.\nへ as a particle had come to be pronounced the same as え.\nを as a particle had come to be pronounced the same as お.\n\nBut the reform chose to leave them as is in writing.2\nHow am I supposed to tell?#\n\nSomething that might worry beginners is: how is one supposed to know if は is actually /ha/ or /wa/ then? In reality, differentiating them is not really an issue as you get used to Japanese.\nは is pronounced as /wa/ only as a particle3. As you get a better understanding of Japanese grammar it'll be easy to tell. At an early stage where you're reading stuff mostly written in kana it's a bit harder, but in a text with kanji it gets much, much easier.\nIs it wrong to write こんにちわ?#\n\nNow, I said it's pronounced this way \"only\" as a particle. This is both true and not. Some words have the は particle \"built into\" them due to their etymology, such that it's really not acting as a particle anymore, but you still write は though you say /wa/. This happens to be the case for こんにちは and こんばんは, which are very common words and a reason beginners might get frustrated by this は↔わ thing.\nこんにちは, if translated very literally, only means \"as for today\". It's actually shortened from larger expressions, like \"How are you today\" or \"It's quite hot today isn't it.\" So that は at the end is in fact the topic particle, it's just not actually acting like it because the expression has been shortened. So, it's \"built-in,\" it's still written は but pronounced as わ.\nNow, you'll actually see Japanese people writing こんにちわ online. That is, however, somewhat slangy. It's not considered the \"proper\" form, and this would only be done, say, as a sort of casual greeting in a chatroom or something. \nSo in a sense, writing it like that could be seen as a sign of fluency if you're doing it intentionally in the right context. Within learning communities, though, this should be avoided, because:\n\nEven if you are aware of what you're doing, a person of lower level might not be, and just end up adopting it without understanding.\nYou'll often be corrected, even if you didn't need to be. Because there are many beginners that do this as a mistake, it's natural that this be pointed out and corrected. It's hard for those around you to know if you know what you're doing.\n\nWhat about ではない and ではありません?#\n\nではない and its polite form ではありません are grammatical constructions people run into early on, though depending on what material you use to study you might initially learn them as じゃない and じゃありません and only later find out about the では forms. They also have は pronounced as /wa/. Is it acting as a particle or is it another case like こんにちは?\nIt's fine to look at it as a case similar to こんにちは without thinking too much about it. These constructions have solidified and work as the default negation for だ and です respectively. These were so common that a contraction developed where the で and は(/wa/) sounds merged into じゃ and those forms have overtaken the usage of the originals (i.e. じゃない is now more common in speech than ではない). So you can just think of it as a single thing and ignore the more complex explanation.\nIt is however a bit different from the こんにちは case, because the word that gives origin to ではない is still a major part of the language. The details for how this works touch on more advanced topics and might not really help clear things up that much, so if you're not that familiar with the grammar yet I'd recommend ignoring this and jumping ahead. The basic idea of it is: ではない comes from である. While looking very similar to ある, である is a copula (meaning it plays a role similar to だ or です) and there's not that much to be gained trying to connect it conceptually to the modern ある. However, it's a strange word because some things can go in between the で and ある bits, most notably the particles は and も. The negative form of である is, in a strict sense, でない, and you'll still see it like that sometimes, but ではない was so much more common that it essentially became the default. Similarly, when you get into more advanced material you'll also see ではある, でもある, and でもない used to give different nuances. While the basic affirmative copula changed from である to だ (and in polite language, です), the negative forms ではない and ではありません stayed as the standard negatives.\nSo why is ではない more common than でない, to the point that it's the standard negative form? That's a bit of a hard question that goes a bit beyond the scope of this page. It's basically there to give the same nuances は usually gives, fitting in a pattern that you'll see across the language where は shows up in a lot of negative sentences to emphasize the negation. Once again, there isn't really a need to worry about it that much, you can just remember it as a set phrase.\nIs を ever pronounced /wo/?#\n\nBasically, no. You may hear it like that in songs, but people don't usually do that when actually speaking. を is now only ever used for the particle. When representing a /wo/ in words imported from other languages, that's usually ウォ, not ヲ. \nIf you ever do see ヲ (or を) as part of a word for some reason (e.g. in ヲタク), it would still be pronounced /o/ and it's probably there for style. \nThe obsolete kana#\n\nThis is more trivia than anything, it's not super relevant, but some learners find it interesting or end up being surprised when they first learn about this. As I said earlier, the orthographic reform obsoleted some kana. Those are:\n\nゑ, in the table position for \"we,\" and its katakana counterpart ヱ.\nゐ, in the table position for \"wi,\" and its katakana counterpart ヰ.\n\nゑ and ゐ, just like を, hadn't actually been pronounced /we/ and /wi/ for a long time. They had shifted to /e/ and /i/, so they ended up being redundant and made obsolete. The same thing would probably have happened with を if it hadn't been left around as a particle. \nThese kana no longer feature in any words, except when used stylistically for names. When you do see them, they'll always be read /e/ and /i/. The sounds /we/ and /wi/ in loan words would be written ウェ and ウィ.\n\n1\n\"The は column\" in the kana table, referring to はひふへほ.\n\n2\nI'm not actually sure why this was done. Perhaps because it makes it easier to go back and read old texts.\n\n3\nLikewise, へ is only pronounced /e/ as a particle\n\n","id":"https://zengor.github.io/japanese/topic-pronunciation/","title":"Why is the topic particle pronounced /wa/ but written は?"},"https://zengor.github.io/mtg-planeswalkers/":{"body":"In this article I am going to discuss Planeswalkers, though not\nexactly from a competitive perspective. The power of the cards in a\ncompetitive sense is relevant as it's a part of the game, and\ndiscussions of power level will feature heavily, but the point isn't\nso much about strategy as it is the overall design of the game, and I\nwon't be giving you the top 10 best cards to use in your favorite\ndeck. The matter also isn't exactly how powerful a card is, but what makes\nit powerful, and how does that power affect the game.\nPlaneswalkers, beyond being a concept central to the Magic story, are\na very divisive card type within the game. They are, as Mark Rosewater\nalways points out, the most popular card type, which may be surprising\nif you are within a bubble of enfranchised players that have gotten\ntired of Planeswalker cards for the many times in which they have\nwarped the metagame or just been a general annoyance.\nIn representing the characters featured in the story, I'd say\nPlaneswalkers are quite succesful, which is probably a major factor in\ntheir popularity. Their unique card frame makes them stand out and the\nabilities tend to be flavorful, as WotC tries to make the cards relate\nto the characters' actual skills and personality, as well as their\nrole in the story of that set. On top of that, now they also try to\ngive each character a distinct mechanical identity, to avoid having\ntoo much overlap in 'walkers in the same colors.\nThe gameplay impact of Planeswalkers, however, is where the division\nof opinion starts to show up. Planeswalkers are continuous value\nengines that greatly overshadow other card types.1 While cards of\nall types can generate value, Planeswalkers are, since their\nconceptual inception as a card type, created to generate continuous\nvalue, and the implementation in actual card designs leans heavily on\nthat fact. Some people draw an apt comparison with Enchantments, but\nmany Enchantments aren't made to generate continuous value, and the\nones that are don't really compare, on average. In other words, there\ncan be instances of Creatures or Enchantments or Artifacts that\ngenerate an absurd amount of value, but Planeswalkers were made to\nbe value engines.\nThis is, in a way, genius. It makes sense for Wizards to want\nPlaneswalker cards to feel powerful, it makes people interested in the\ncards, which tends to lead to them feeling a connection with the\ncharacters. The power→interest relationship is inherent to how Magic\nhas been designed. The problem is when they become too powerful. As\nhas been pointed out\nbefore,\nit's R&amp;D's job to try and make interesting, powerful cards, while\nstill being careful that no card is breaking the game.\nI am not going to argue Planeswalkers are inherently too powerful and\nnever should have been made. It's true that they significantly altered\nhow Magic is played, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. In fact,\na lot of my comments are more about how cards play and how they affect\nthe game than their competitive viability or dominance. I think it's\ninteresting to analyze and understand how easy it is for them to\ndominate the game. This isn't meant to be dictating how planeswalkers\n\"should\" be made. I have no power over R&amp;D and I find it unlikely\nanything I discuss here will be news to them, not that anyone there\nwill be reading this anyway. I think R&amp;D understands quite well the\ndesign of their own game. But as humans they, too, make mistakes, and\nwith a game as complex as MtG, there is a lot of room for mistakes. If\nsomething I say does end up sounding like a suggestion or an argument,\nit will be just some thoughts on potential directions that could be\ntaken that I think would be interesting.\nThis article is just gathering my thoughts as I study a single aspect\nof this complex game. Both the successes and mistakes interest me\ngreatly just out of my own hobbyist interest in game design, and I\nthink it can be surprisingly relevant to the design of other games.\nIntroduction: How Magic works\nI want to start off with a basic rundown of how the game works, to\nestablish the framing I will be using throughout the rest of this pile\nof words, and to give this article potential use beyond Magic\nplayers. I don't think anyone is going to read this expecting to learn\nhow to play, but with some of the mechanics explained it's possible\nthat people who haven't played much can understand from the\nperspective of game design. As such, my explanations will be less\ndidactic and more analytical. Interestingly enough, Magic has so many\ndifferent aspects to it and different ways of playing that it can be\nsurprisingly hard to sum it up -- it's one of the reasons people who\nplay Magic seem to be speaking gibberish -- but I'll try to give a\nrundown. First I want to contextualize Magic through the different\nways to play and other meta aspects, such as banning and\nformats. Then, I'll establish actual gameplay concepts in abstract\nterms. I'll finish with a much more technical explanation of certain\naspects of the rules. People may pick and choose which parts they\nactually need to read, and skip the rest.\nContext and meta aspects\nMagic is actually not a single game, but a family of games that share\na large portion of their rules and game objects. The specific rules\nwith which you play Magic are known as a \"format.\" There are two kinds\nof formats: Limited and Constructed. Limited formats consist of\nopening a Magic product (usually Booster Packs) and playing with those\ncards. I'm not going to focus too much on the specifics of Limited2\nin the main article. Limited is a great way to play, but\nPlaneswalkers, due to usually being mythic rare cards (the highest\nrarity), don't have as much impact on most Limited formats, their\nimpact is felt the most in Constructed.\nConstructed formats are more like what people probably picture card\ngames as: you bring your own deck (or, well, borrow someone's deck)\nand play with it. Different constructed formats define different cards\nwhich can be used, usually based on some sort of release time\nframe. For example, Modern is a format in which you can play all cards\nprinted in Expansion sets and Core sets starting in July 2003 (Core\nSet 8th Edition), except for ones explicitly banned.\nSpecifically banning cards is something that exists in all Constructed\nformats, but it's generally seen as necessary evil at best. There is\nthe concept of the \"health\" of a format. When there are many different\npossible strategies that are fun, the format is healthy. The format is\nconsidered unhealthy when a specific strategy is too dominant, being a\nlarge percentage of the metagame, or when a strategy that has started\nto become prominent is considered \"degenerate,\" that is, somehow\nexploiting the game in a way that is considered to be hampering the\nfun of other players as a whole. Incredibly fast combo kills in the\nearly turns of the game, where an opponent using a \"fair\" deck has no\nchance of doing anything, is the prototypical example of a degenerate\nstrategy.\nBans are used when the format has become too unhealthy, to the point\nwhere it's deemed as a threat to the continued success of the format\n(usually based on how much people want to play it, measured by\ntournament attendance). Banning a card always makes people who like\nthe card, or have spent a lot of money acquiring the card, angry. WotC\nthus believes that banning constantly is in itself dangerous for the\ngame, as that can drive many people away. They are thus hesistant (and\noften have been too slow) with bans, and try to pinpoint bans to the\nmost problematic card. They prefer that formats grow naturally, by\npeople figuring out counter strategies, or with new cards introducing\nnew possibilities or shaking up the format.\nAs I mentioned in passing before, there is a sense in which bans are a\nsign of trying to make an exciting game. The safe way to avoid bans is\nto make cards that couldn't possibly break the game, and just repeat\nthings you know work. But people want to play with exciting cards,\ncards that feel powerful, or do strange new things no card has done\nbefore, and so one of the aspects of designing Magic is often to go\nfor a walk at the edge of the abyss of broken cards while trying not to\nfall into it. As humans, they try but don't always succeed.\nThe Constructed format WotC champions the most is Standard (as the\nname would imply), which is a rotating format. This means that as\ntime goes on, cards eventually \"rotate out,\" and can no longer be\nused. This is, of course, financially beneficial for WotC, as players\nhave to keep getting new cards to play. On the other hand, it still\nserves multiple game design purposes. The nature of eternal formats\n(ones that do not rotate) is that they get increasingly complex over\ntime, making it much more difficult for new players to come in. It\nalso gets harder and harder for them to balance the entire format. On\ntop of that, without a rotating format, the best way to make sure\npeople buy new cards is to make increasingly powerful and eventually\nbroken cards, greatly accelerating power creep. While they can still\ndo that to incentivize people who play eternal formats to buy product,\nhaving Standard means they can have a format with a controlled power\nlevel that also changes relatively quickly.\nDecks in Standard tend to change greatly with each set release (every\n3 months or so), or at least change once cards used in it rotate out,\ncreating an environment that can feel quite fresh even after just a\nfew months. Meanwhile, as people \"solve\" an eternal format, decks can\nstay competitive for years with only a few cards needing to change\nfrom time to time. That is an advantage for many, of course, as they\ncan just keep their favorite deck with the cards they already have,\nbut being able to explore a smaller, regularly changing metagame makes\nStandard an interesting prospect even for many experienced and old\ntime players.\nIt is WotC's stated philosophy that Standard should have a controlled\npower level and controlled complexity. This doesn't mean that cards\nshould be weak or not fun to play, but that the format shouldn't be\ntoo hard to understand (as that makes it worse for more casual players\nand newcomers), and should have a somewhat slower pace compared to\nformats like Modern. This smaller pool of cards is also better to\nexplore new mechanics or revisit old ones, as new designs can compete\nagainst each other in a smaller environment instead of having to\ncompete with many years worth of cards3. Rotation also allows them\nto \"fix\" the game over time: Standard reflects the changes in their\nideas on how the game should be and their design philosophy\nevolves. Past mistakes can live forever in eternal formats, barring a\nban.\nNot all formats were created by WotC. Many casual variants have been\ncreated by fans as they explore new ways to enjoy the game, such as\nCommander, which is now one of the most popular formats, has become\ncodified in the official game rules, and has products designed by WotC\ntargeting those who play it. One interesting thing is that WotC still\ndoes not have full control of the format rules or ban lists, as a\nseparate council is in charge of that.\nThe existence of many different ways to play is perhaps one of the\nmost appealing aspects of Magic and one of the reasons for its\nsuccess, and I don't really see anything at this scale in other card\ngames. Players can be constantly enjoying and analyzing cards at\ndifferent levels in the contexts of the formats they're interested in,\nboth Limited and Constructed, and having different formats allows\npeople to move to a new one when they so desire, be it because they're\ntired of the metagame they were playing in before, or just because\nit's fun to explore and recontextualize these objects and concepts\nyou're already familiar with. WotC recently announced a new format,\nPioneer, with a card pool starting in 2013. This has been long-awaited\nby many players, and has drawn a lot of excitement. Players who played\nduring those years, particularly those that started in that time frame\nand feel nostalgic, can revisit their previous favorite cards and\ndecks that were simply not working in, say, Modern. Standard being in\na particularly bad place at the time of the announcement also greatly\ncontributed to the excitement, as players who wanted to get away but\nsaw the jump to Modern as unappealing had a fresh new format in its\ninfancy. This means that, despite a displeasing Standard, many people\nkept playing Magic instead of moving on to anything else.\nOverview of how the game is played\nNow, for an explanation of the actual game (namely, the rules and\nconcepts that are shared between formats). Magic is a card game for\ntwo or more players. Players usually win by reducing their opponents'\nlife points to zero (with 20 being the starting life total for most\ncompetitive formats), though there are alternate modes of\nvictory. This includes milling4, but many cards have as part of\ntheir effect explicitly defined alternativate ways to win, or to make\npeople lose, so players can build new decks around them.\nPlayers take turns using cards that represent magical spells. To use\nthem, you usually need to pay a cost using a resource known as\nmana. There are 5 colors of mana (White, Blue, Black, Red, Green),\nthough it can also be colorless. Each color has a philosophy, a\nmeaning, a personality. The colors are a foundational aspect of the\ngame, they inform not only flavor, but the ideas of each color help\ninfluence what they can do in gameplay terms. The game is built\nthrough spreading different abilities and themes between the 5\ncolors, which also means colors have their own limitations.\nPowerful effects are costed to match, such that they can't be used\nearly in the game. This shapes the game so it can often\nbe increasingly exciting as players do more complex, powerful\nplays. It affects deckbuilding and viable strategies as well. Relying\ntoo much on highly costed spells means you do nothing in the early\ngame, and thus are easily defeated by more aggressive low cost\nstrategies, but relying entirely on low cost cards can be potentially\ndetrimental because you might not be able to answer powerful high cost\nthreats appropriately.\nThe main way to get mana is through Land cards. Lands cost no mana,\nand you can play one in each of your turns, so you generally have more\nmana as the game goes on, contributing to the pacing. Each color has a\nBasic Land card, of which you can have as many as you want in your\ndeck (while most cards are limited to 4, or to 1 depending on the\nformat). There are also different kinds of non-basic lands. You can\nhave cards of any number of colors in your decks5, but mana and\nlands serve as a balacing act that make it difficult to simply play\nthe best cards of each color, and also give the game a sense of\npacing.\nTo be able to play cards of a certain color you usually need to play\nlands that produce that color. As lands are cards that are part of\nyour deck, you must draw them to be able to play them. Trying to use\nall colors means you have to have lands for each color, but having\nmany different kinds of lands means you are less likely to draw the\nones of the color you need when you need them. Not that the game is\ndesigned in opposition to multicolor decks, there are many lands that\nproduce two or more colors, and other ways to make sure you get the\ncolors of mana you need. But playing a multicolor deck means having an\ninherent problem of consistency which must be carefully considered\nwhile building your deck, and it gets more difficult the more colors\nyou use.\nOn top of that, the number of lands is also important. Having too few\nlands makes it unlikely that you'll have a good number of them in your\nstarting hand, making it difficult to use your other cards. Having too\nmany means you might end up drawing lands too often when in the mid to\nlate game you'd rather be drawing cards that can help you win. While\nthis helps give additional depth to deckbuilding, it's also the\nbiggest problem with Magic's mana/land system. \"Mana screw\" (too few\nlands) and \"Mana flood\" (too many lands) are two aspects inherent to\nthis system. While smart deckbuilding helps mitigate this, decks being\nrandomized means it's just statistically inevitable that you'll be\nfaced with games where it's really not your fault you lost. The mana\nproblem is the worst aspect of the game's design.\nThis doesn't mean the idea of lands is entirely broken, far from\nit. If you have no resource like this, the pace of the game is\ncompletely different (with the idea of \"lategame\" being somewhat\nirrelevant), matches are too swingy towards good initial hands, and\nit's much easier for decks to start to feel the same as people figure\nout the most effective cards for each purpose, even while trying to\nbuild decks around different strategies. This last part is also true\nfor games with a resource system where the resource is generic,\nwithout an analogue to colors. To really be interesting, those games\nhave to find other ways to create deckbuilding restrictions that allow\nfor varied strategies and gameplay. Magic, meanwhile, with colors\nbeing mechanically distinct and needing specific lands, has great\nfreedom through its restrictions. A deckbuilder is given access to\nmany possbilities through any combination of colors in whatever way\nthey choose, but which have to be carefully weighted against the\ndifficulty of accessing those colors consistently and quickly, so that\ntheir deck isn't overpowered by a strategy with a less difficult mana\nbase. While you can always switch to playing what appears to be the\nstrongest color combination in the metagame, when combined with smart\ncard designs, you usually have some balance, with very different\ndecks and strategies standing at about the same level\ncompetitively. That's even ignoring the fact that people become\nattached to the gameplay of their favorite colors and favorite cards,\nand try to use the varied card pool to strengthen their pet strategies\nrather than follow what they see at the top.\nExamining and comparing the different ways that games do try to fix\nthe mana problem or provide alternative restrictions to deckbuilding\nis very interesting. I'm particularly interested in how Force of Will\nhandles it. In theory it seems to be a great solution that\neliminates mana flood and mana screw, with colors, while still\nallowing the strength of effects to escalate as the game goes\non. However, I haven't had the opportunity to really play the game\nvery much to tell how effectively it's executed.\nTechnicalities\nWhile I've given a very high-level overview, I think I should get into\nmore technical rules terms, as many things I touch on are related to\nmore nuanced aspects of the rules, and thus use terminology related to\nthat. You may want to skip this if the details feel too irrelevant, and\ncome back to check when needed.\nPlayers actually take turns in two different ways. There is \"a\nplayer's turn,\" which is the sequence of phases that starts with them\nuntapping their permanents. However, players are constantly getting\nand passing \"priority\" as the turn progresses. To have priority means\nto be able to take actions. Permanents and Sorceries can only be\nplayed on your own turn's main phase while the stack is empty (I'll\ntouch on the stack in a little bit), unless an effect states\notherwise, but on the other hand, Instants and most activated\nabilities can be used any time you have priority, even in another\nplayer's turn. These are the rules that govern Magic's large amounts of\nplayer interactivity, determining when you can respond to what your\nopponent did.\nTo advance to the next phase within a turn, or to move to the next\nturn, all players must pass priority in succession, without taking\naction. The turn player always gets priority first, takes their\nactions, then passes priority to the next player. In the paper game,\nthis is mostly done implicitly, and a player will explicitly say they\nhave a response, otherwise it's often assumed they are just passing\npriority. When the turn player thinks there might be a response or an\nopponent may want to take action before a phase transition, they may\nask about it or say \"move to ,\" just to prevent going forward\ntoo quickly, e.g. the other player having to say \"wait, before combat\"\nafter you already went and declared your attackers. \nIn digital versions of the game, this priority system is something of\na problem because technically within the rules a player may\nrespond, but asking to pass priority every time the user receives it\nis very clunky. A lot of times players have nothing they can actually\ndo as they may have no spells or abilities they can legally use or pay\nthe costs for. On top of that, players receive priority during the\nupkeep and the draw step, but most of the time no one does anything. A\ndigital implementation that wants to be a smooth experience thus needs\nto have some way of figuring out when priority is actually relevant,\nwhich may end up working against the players if it mistakenly passes\npriority when the player actually does want to respond or work with\nthe minutiae of the rules and do something that asks for very specific\ntiming and sequencing.\nMost actions result in adding something to a zone called the \"stack.\"\nThis is true of casting spells, activating abilities, but also of\ntriggered abilities, though they are put on the stack as a result of\nan event, as opposed to direct player decision. While on the stack,\nspells and abilities usually don't do much, with the actual effect\nonly happening when it \"resolves.\"  While an object is on the stack, a\nplayer with priority may respond with their own actions (usually an\nInstant or an activated ability), usually creating a new object on the\nstack, which other players will have a chance to respond to. A spell\nor ability only starts to resolve when all players pass priority in\nsuccession. The last object to be put on the stack resolves\nfirst. The name of this zone will make this immediately understandable\nto anyone that does programming, as it's the same principle as the\ndata structure: Last In, First Out.\nAs the responses take effect first, when an object starts to resolve,\nin many cases it won't resolve, or do nothing instead. The cases\nwhere it would do nothing are pretty natural. If an effect says\n\"return all creatures to their owner's hands,\" and there are no longer\ncreatures on the battlefield, the effect takes place -- but nothing\nactually changes. But a spell may be unable to resolve by becoming\n\"illegal.\" A spell with targets doesn't resolve if the targets no\nlonger exist, or are no longer something the spell is allowed to\ntarget. For a concrete example: If a hypothetical spell says \"destroy\ntarget nonblack creature, then draw a card,\" and as a response a\nplayer is able to make their creature gain black as one of their\ncolors, the target is no longer legal. The spell won't resolve, take\nno effect, and the player will not draw a card, and simply put the\nspell in its owner's graveyard. This is colloquially known as\n\"fizzling.\" This structure allows players to immediately react and\nadapt their gameplan to what their opponents do.\nAnother important aspect of the game is that abilities on the stack in\ngeneral are somewhat detached from their source. For example, many\ncreatures have an effect of the form \"When this creature enters the\nbattlefield [...].\" No player gets priority between the creature\nentering the battlefield and the ability entering the stack, by the\ntime anyone can act, it exists on the stack and must either be\nresponded to or resolve. As long as the effect doesn't depend on the\ncreature's existence, which is most ETB6 effects, it will resolve\neven if the creature is destroyed or leaves the battlefield in any\nway. This include even effects that do damage. If a creature\nhas \"ETB, deals 2 damage to any target,\" the damage will happen even\nif the source of the ability is destroyed. To stop the effect you'd\nnormally have to make the target become illegal.\nI can't possibly explain every aspect and mechanic of the game that\nwill be covered in the rest of this article, but hopefully that is\nenough context that someone may understand the major points.\n3-mana planeswalkers\nAs continuous value engines, it's easy for Planeswalkers to generate\nan impact much larger than their mana cost, so the cheaper they are,\nthe more dangerous they tend to be. Multiple 3-mana planeswalkers made\nso far have been a problem over the years. This is an even greater\ndanger for Standard. As a slower format, many decks aren't able to\nreally establish themselves by turn 3, so the impact a 3-mana\nplaneswalker has as it enters into play heavily influences what is\npossible in the metagame.\nThe most recent problem is, of course, Oko. I will talk more about Oko\nin card-specific breakdowns. In this section I want to discuss this\ncategory as a whole, rather than complain about one specific\nmistake. Many things in this section apply to walkers of all\nCMCs, but the 3-mana ones are an interesting microcosm to start this\nwith. This in theory applies even more to 2-mana walkers, but that\ncategory is too small so I'll just save them for the card-specific\nbreakdowns.\nIt's not as if a 3-mana walker is inherently broken; in fact, the\n3-mana walkers at uncommon and rare that were recently introduced in\nWar of the Spark and Core Set 2020 are generally fine. Even if some are a\nbit annoying, they aren't really oppressive. They are, however, a bit\ndifferent from how Planeswalkers have been designed so far, as the\nlower rarity already makes Wizards turn down the power level of the\ncards. \nThe uncommon planeswalkers from WAR in paricular (not only the 3-mana\nones), are the walkers that best fit the Enchantment comparison. As\nthey have no positive loyalty ability, the value they can generate by\nthemselves is greatly limited. Some of the static abilities allow for\nadditional value, but not in a way that is very different from how\ncreatures and enchantments work.\nThe potential for a Planeswalker to break the game is related to the\nvalue it is able to generate immediately, its survivability, and the\nvalue it generates over time. This isn't, in principle, that different\nfrom other permanents, the difference just being in the average value\nwe are discussing. \nPer Card Analysis\nTeferi, Time Raveler\nTeferi, Time Raveler   1WU\nLegendary Planeswalker - Teferi\n\nEach opponent can cast spells only any time they could cast a sorcery.\n\n+1: Until your next turn, you may cast sorcery spells as though they had flash.\n\n-3: Return up to one target artifact, creature, or enchantment to its owner's hand. Draw a card.\n\nLike all Teferi planeswalker cards, Time Raveler wonderfully executes\na gameplay representation of the character's abilities to manipulate\ntime. And I have to imagine that fighting a time-manipulating wizard\nwould indeed be as frustrating as facing this card.\nBy shutting down instant removal, this Teferi necessarily slows down\nthe opposing side. A major play pattern in the game is to leave lands\nunused to be able to respond to your opponent's threats during their\nturn while keeping the option to use the mana for other Instants that\nadvance your plans, such as drawing cards, in the case where they do\nnot present anything meaningful to respond to, or which you can't\nhandle at the moment. Teferi is able to shut down this kind of\nresponse, with only blue being able to really answer through counter\nspells, achieving a major win in tempo.\nEven against decks that don't use as many instants, Teferi's -3 gives\nhim the ability to bounce most types of permanents //TODO\n[...]\nI think I'm not the first one to think that they should have perhaps\nswitched this card's static ability with its +1 ability. That would\nmake the card much less frustrating to deal with, as using the bounce\neffect would mean not getting the additional advantage of priving your\nopponents from instant-speed casting, and as the +1 would be an\nactivated ability, opponents would have a final chance to respond to\nthe activation. Easy fix, right?\nThis does, however, severely weaken the card. Teferi's static ability\nis a major source of survivability. Would this card really see as much\nplay if an opponent could respond to a +1 with a Fry, or to a -3\nwith just any 1 or 2 damage spell? The +1 case in particular would\nlead to quite a few feelbads, as you get essentially no value out of your\ncard. This wouldn't exactly be something new, however. That's the\npoint of responses, after all. You generally get no value if your\nspell is countered, many creatues provide little to no value if you\ndon't get to attack use their activated abilities. I've talked before\nabout being a scapegoat or distraction for your opponents' removal\nspells is actually one of the ways that planeswalkers generate value,\nbut it's not that much by itself. In this version of the card, playing\nthis and activating the +1 ability in the early game would often be \"3\nmana, do nothing.\" Sure you stopped your opponents from doing\ninstant-speed casting for one turn, but is that really enough?\nAn additional step might be to then move the Draw effect from the -3 to the\n+1 ability. Even if Teferi is killed in response, you would have lost\n1 card to draw another, which for 3 mana isn't that great, but that\nfits with what you get from most other planeswalkers killed\nimmediately after a + activation, something slightly below rate. This\nchanges the feel of the card, however. In a way it's even more\npowerful, as it can continuously provide card draw. Currently, people\nsometimes -3 Teferi mostly for the card draw effect in a time of need,\nwhich then means they can't draw immediately again or use the bounce\neffect if you put down a bigger threat. A +1 with card draw \nOko, Thief of Crowns\nOko, Thief of Crowns    1UR \nLegendary Planeswalker - Oko\n\n+2: Create a Food token.\n\n+1: Target artifact or creature loses all abilities and becomes a green Elk creature with base power and toughness 3/3.\n\n-5: Exchange control of target artifact or creature you control and target creature an opponent controls with power 3 or less.\n\nLoyalty: 4\n\nWhen I first saw Oko previewed, I was a bit baffled. But well, my\npredictions on what cards will be strong and widely played are often\nwrong, and I'm always aware of that as I evaluate cards before the set\nis released. Evaluating Magic cards by themselves can only go so far,\nas the game is played through card interactions78. That's why\npeople, even pro players with years of experience, often make entirely\nwrong evaluations of a card's impact until it actually gets to\ninteract with the surrounding format.\nOko, however, just seemed... numerically broken. After seeing the card\nhave impact in all major Constructed formats where it is legal, I was\na bit puzzled on how this happened because to me the numbers just look\nso clearly wrong. I've since tried to make sense of R&amp;D's line of\nthinking, so I'll start with that side of it, and then get to the\nproblems with the card.\nFood tokens are not great value in and of themselves. Each one allows\nyou to gain 3 life for 2 mana, which is not particularly great. Sure,\nit can save you in a pinch, but compared to the previous Clue tokens\n(Pay 2 mana to draw a card) and Treasure tokens (Add 1 mana of any\ncolor), they are not particularly interesting. Outside of life gain\ndecks, gaining life is not something players value greatly, except if\nit's incidental life gain, where you are also achieving something\nelse alongside that. For example, Knight of Autumn is an incredibly\nversatile card, and its life gain effect may be the least used, but\nit's often relevant in matchups against aggro decks when you are just\nlooking to stabilize. However, it's not the life gain that makes the\ncard good, it's the versatility and the fact that when combined with\nits other two effects make the card cover so much ground that the\npotential to gain life is an added bonus. The value of Food tokens is\nderived not really from the tokens themselves, but from the synergy\nwith cards that care about Food tokens to achieve another effect. So\nin a way, the first ability doesn't do anything. You need additional\nsetup to be able to draw significant value from them. It was perhaps\nhard to be sure if Food would even be relevant in Constructed at\nall. Therefore it makes sense to have the value of the ability be a\nsignificant jump in Loyalty counters.\nThe +1 ability is how Oko protects himself. You are either making\nsomething of yours a 3/3, or something of your opponents a 3/3. In the\nformer case, the downside is losing your abilities, and in the latter,\nit's that it's not hard removal: your opponent still has a 3/3, the\npoint is just making it lose its abilities, or make a big thing\nsmaller. The downside can be pretty significant, so an additional loss\nof loyalty might perhaps make it not see much use. On top of that, at\nits current starting loyalty of 4, a -1 would put it at the exact\nrange for the Elk to kill Oko, which kind of defeats the purpose of a\nprotection ability in the first place.\nA combined aspect of the two abilities is the case of not having any\ngood targets to use the +1 ability on. The board may be entirely\ndevoid of creatures early in the game, or in many cases targeting your\nopponent's creature might make it stronger while you have no creatures\nin play. As such, the +2 allows Oko to set up his +1 for the next\nturn, by creating an artifact. In the case of your opponents already\nhaving a creature, it would thus be ideal that it bought you a bit\nmore time.\nThe \"ultimate\" in this case is a powerful effect with severe\nlimitations, and is not necessarily game ending. More and more\nplaneswalkers have distanced away from traditional ultimates into\nabilities like this, which are powerful utility rather than your goal\nto win the game. In these cases, the loyalty requirements tend to be\nlow enough for them to be used a larger percentage of the time.\nIn this perspective, the card makes sense, and is pretty exciting, but\nnot necessarily broken. It's an aggressively costed Planeswalker, with\ngood abilities that come with downsides to compensate.\nNow let's look at it in another way. Oko is a 3-mana planeswalker //TODO\nOko is actually a card that takes a reasonable amount of skill to use\neffectively. In fact, Oko Food deck mirror matches during Standard at\nthe time were quite skill-intensive, a bad player would be unlikely to\nwin. But that doesn't mean the card is clunky to use. It doesn't take\nthat long to study what to do with him, especially not if every second\nplayer you're up against is using him and you get a good sample of\nwhat people do. Once you have an idea of how to use him, the card is\nsimply too powerful in a color that is plenty able to support it to\nmaximum efficiency.\nThis is similar to what happened in Jace, the Mind Sculptor and the\nCaw-Blade deck. \n1\nYou could argue Lands are the most powerful value engines as they give you mana every turn, but I don't think that fits the concept of \"value,\" and doesn't square with how people think of Lands. Lands when used for mana are not giving you additional value, they are providing a resource; mana being Magic's main resource. While getting additional resources, or being able to get the particular color you need, is in a sense, \"value,\" the term more appropriately applies to something that you need to spend resources to do. The idea is that the card gives you more than what you'd expect for its cost. That is, you are getting things \"for free.\" You could argue that utility lands are value engines, but even in that case, they tend to be less efficient, as Wizards appropriately icreases the cost of the ability to compensate it being repeatable and on a Land (which you don't need to pay mana to play). Planeswalkers, however, tend to be mana efficient and only require a single payment.\n\n9\nOne of them, the original Tibalt, is just bad because they couldn't let themselves make it too strong at that CMC. Wrenn and Six, released in a set with a higher average power level than Standard-legal sets, is perhaps more representative of the potential power of 2-mana walkers. Interestingly, it will likely look bad to a new player, as its two first abilities are not exactly splashy. But it is an absurd amount of value for 2 mana once you start to see the potential in Eternal formats. Wrenn and Six sits as the most expensive card in Modern Horizons in secondary markets at time of writing. Before being banned in Legacy, it was about double the price of the second place contenders, Force of Negation and Urza, Lord High Artificer. At time of writing, it's now only about 1.5 times more expensive than Urza.\n\n4\nOne of the rules of the game is that if you attempt to draw out of a library (deck) with no cards in it, you lose the game. This is known as \"decking out,\" or \"milling out,\" and some like to build mill decks focused on it, using cards that make people put cards off the top of their library into their graveyard (this act itself is known as \"milling\"), or by forcing their opponents to draw too many cards. The name comes from a card named Millstone, which was the first to have the effect. This is far from the most popular strategy, but it's stil a thing many like doing, and there is usually some way to build mill decks in any Constructed format, with varying levels of success, and it's sometimes an archetype for Limited environments. \n\n10\nThe most popular type of Limited is Booster Draft, in which a number of players (traditionally 6 or 8) sit around a table with a number of packs, open one, pick a single card out of the pack, and pass along the rest of the booster to the person next to them; eventually moving on and passing around all the packs. Then players build decks using the cards they picked. This allows for strategy as well as variation.\n\n2\nThis also applies in many sections of this article, of course. I try to examine cards by themselves through a sort of theory of value, but that value means nothing as a single card, so that approach is limited. That's why I try to bring up example interactions to give some basis to what I'm saying. But those necessarily have to be format specific, I could go on and on about how Oko interacts with Gilded Goose, but in Legacy they don't play him with Gilded Goose at all. That's why I try to use these examples as a stepping stone to approach a more generalized, format-agnostic view of the card's design, instead of just laying out all relevant specific interactions that involve the card.\n\n8\nAn interesting point related to this is when one tries to read cards of different card games.\n\n3\nHowever, a side effect of having so many formats is that players not playing Standard still want new, fun, and strong cards for their format. So as other formats get more popular, WotC sees the need to respond to that desire, and thus their designs have to go back to competing with cards all over Magic history to receive fan appraisal. Indeed, lately many cards in Standard-legal sets are clearly made with Commander in mind, even to the point where they couldn't realistic have an impact in any competitive format but would just be fun for Commander. And that's even though Commander already has products specifically targeted at it, first early, and now multiple times a year. In other words, what they try to do is make cards that can be relevant in other formats while not being relevant in Standard, or try to have a certain amount of powerful Standard cards be playable in other formats. Modern players' cries for more support of the format is one of the reasons that they made Modern Horizons, a major set that skips Standard legality but is legal in Modern, with a higher power level and complexity than what they want for Standard, to allow themselves more room to make cards experienced players would enjoy. They didn't make just cards for Modern either, many cards were made thinking of other Eternal formats that want new tools, but the tools need a higher power level than Standard can consistently provide. Having supplemental products targeted at other formats is perhaps the most efficient way to give what those players want. It's not that the path through Standard never has strong cards (in fact, many from recent Standard decks have seen play in eternal formats), it's that it takes too much time for there to be an amount of relevant new cards that can significantly alter the eternal formats, on average. Commander is a special case, as it's not a competitive format. They need strong cards as well, but often cards for Commander are Legendary Creatures that have interesting or fun effects so people can build decks around them.\n\n5\nSome formats define additional restrictions. For example, in Commander you have a card that you deem your commander, and you can only have cards within that commander's color identity in your deck.\n\n6\n\"Enters the battlefield\" effects are incredibly common for permanents in the game, and so people just refer to them as \"ETB\" effects, or \"ETBs.\" \n\n","id":"https://zengor.github.io/mtg-planeswalkers/","title":"An analysis of the design of Planeswalkers"},"https://zengor.github.io/portfolio/acotsp/":{"body":"Background\nIn university, I was invited to be part of a team working on the application of metaheuristics. This was not a topic covered in any of my available classes, so I found it to be a good opportunity to tackle something outside of coursework. Our actual task was to implement a hybrid of metaheuristics1 with direct solvers, but that contact with metaheuristics made me interested in doing something related for my graduation project.\nWhat is it?\nAnt Colony Optimization is a metaheuristic technique inspired by the behavior of real ants. It imagines the problem space as a graph, with a collection of mostly-independent agents (artificial ants) trying to find a path. The ants walk through the graph in a probabilistic manner, depositing \"pheromones\" wherever they go, proportional to the quality of the solution they find. The pheromones influence the probability that a later ant will make the same movement. Over time, the colony will converge towards good solutions.\nOne thing I found interesting about ACO was how its structure can be easily transferred to parallel execution in quite a few different ways. I decided to study that as part of my Bachelor's thesis, and as part of that I wanted to see how application of one model (master-slave) works out for the two most popular ACO variants (ACS and MMAS) in a multicore architecture (as most research still focuses on computer clusters).\nDetails\nThe project is implemented in Rust, using Rayon. The Travelling Salesman Problem was picked for testing as it's the prototypical problem for which ACO is implemented.\nThe implementation is relatively straightforward, though there is a bit of ugly code repetition in a couple of places. There is a trait Colony which defines the basic behavior an ant colony supports, and 3 implementors, Mmas, Acs, and AcsPar. Once the colony is initialized, they all follow the basic ACO loop, which, in pseudocode, is:\nwhile not done: // time and/or iteration limit\n    construct_solutions()\n    update_pheromones()\n\nFor all colonies, pheromones are stored in a matrix of f64s (the values are wrapped in RwLocks in AcsPar), alongside heuristic information on the problem instance (an additional heuristic that advantages edges with lesser weight, calculated once on initialization). There is an additional matrix that combines both the pheromone and metaheuristic values so that the ants do not have to make the calculation every time they read the data. \n1\nTo be specific, Generic Algorithm and Simmulated Annealing.\n\n","id":"https://zengor.github.io/portfolio/acotsp/","title":"Parallelized Ant Colony Optimization"},"https://zengor.github.io/some-article/":{"body":"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
